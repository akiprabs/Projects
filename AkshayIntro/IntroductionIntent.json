==>  
Introduction of AUI into Devportal
--> Used AUI to launch the Suppressions project

Lead the launch discussions of DSV and DP spilt
Lead the launch of Gen8 devices 
--> by creating the query required to copy over the CIC intent in DP

Introduced the BB devices in DP in a completely new AUI styled modal 
--> Migrated the Amazon devices to the Modal.

==> I had suggested Michael Caldwell to introduce the Devices Modal in the Detail page
==> Later I had added the edit button in the Device Modal in the device Modal, where we had some disagreements :P
